<h1>"Fashion Singularity" and AI</h1>
<p>Written on: 2024-09-24</p><p>I used to work in retail, in a clothing store. The job was rewarding in its own
right, monotonous but visible, and it was fun to discover new ways to be
efficient (I might talk about that in another post) or problem solve (you have
to do a surprisingly large amount of problem solving when working in retail - a
lot of it comes down to how resourceful you are to be honest). The work was not
skilled however, and left me a lot of time to think, and listen to music while
thinking.</p>
<p>There's one particular thought experiment I keep coming back to even after I've
left, that I think is a little interesting to discuss, especially because it
kind of relates to technology and what we're currently seeing with AI and this
new era of the internet. I call it "fashion singularity", and in this post I'm
going to explain what that is and why I think it's important to at least
consider/understand.</p>
<h2>Fashion Singularity</h2>
<p>This thought experiment is a bit far-fetched so please bear with me.</p>
<p>Let's say you have a clothing company that wishes to maximise its sales and
profits. In order to do so, they choose to produce and sell whatever the latest
trends in fashion are (on the basis that customers only want the latest
fashion and nothing else). In order to do so, the company does one of two
things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Produce clothes in the same style as the latest fashion trend (copy).</li>
<li>Buy other companies that sell the latest fashion trend in order produce
   their fashion while also eliminating competition (consume).</li>
</ol>
<p>At the beginning, the company will only be able to only copy because they have
limited profits, but as time goes on and they become more successful, they will
slowly be able to consume as well, eventually becoming a megacorporation like
snowflakes becoming an avalanche. Let's assume they are extremely successful:
this mega brand has managed to consume every other brand in the world and now
produces the latest fashion. A question:</p>
<p><strong>What happens to fashion?</strong> Or, more cynically: <strong>at what point is fashion
determined by this company?</strong></p>
<p>At the beginning of this thought experiment, the latest fashion is determined
by some outside force. Part of it might be the customer, part of it may be the
industry, it could be some outside external factor that dictates what materials
are available and thus what sort of clothes can be made... there are various
factors but to keep it simple we'll just say that the customer is by and large
the determining factor in what is currently fashionable - they get to choose
what they buy and "vote with their wallet".</p>
<p>Again however, as time goes on and other companies are consumed, the customers
choices become limited and they are forced to pick from a more limited range of
clothing. <em>The company effectively chooses what customers can buy.</em> They might
for instance produce only chinos and stop selling jeans, and by virtue of the
fact that no one is buying/wearing jeans anymore, chinos become fashionable. We
have reached fashion singularity - the company picks and chooses what customers
wear simply by producing it.</p>
<p>At this point, one could say that fashion as a concept ceases to exist. The
choice in clothing available to customers is limited, and without access to
alternative choices it remains this way forever. Several interesting avenues
open up: the company may choose to produce identical styles of fashion in years
previous, cycling through older styles with additional tweaks to keep things
fresh. They may choose to optimise their product to an extreme, designing and
selling clothes that are incredibly cheap to make and sell for a high price.
There's lots of different things that happen - and all the while, the customer
is given the illusion of free choice.</p>
<p>People no longer choose the clothes they wear completely. The company gives them
a preset selection, and determines what the future of that preset selection
looks like. Fashion is dead.</p>
<h2>AI and SCP 3125</h2>
<p>Obviously fashion doesn't work in this way and there are several flaws with
this thought experiment that mean it would never hold water in the real world.
The point of this thought experiment isn't its logistics, it's the implications
it has for technology and how we currently use AI.  The way AI/LLMs are being
used to generate content for the internet is not dissimilar to how our
fictitious company consumes content from other websites and regurgitates it in
a slightly different format. Unlike our company, AI tools are still consuming
and producing content at a pace impossible for humans to keep up and are giving
no signs of stopping any time soon. What's even more worrying is that the
AI-generated content of one website may indeed be produced from the
AI-generated content of another website like an ouroborous, which leads me to
question:</p>
<p><strong>What on the internet is actually real? What has been made by humans and not
reproduced (potentially for the n-th time) by AI?</strong></p>
<p>We're currently seeing a lot of AI generated slop (a term coined by someone
much smarter than I am who no doubt has had these thoughts already) populate
and almost consume the internet. Like SCP 3125, this "fashion-singularity"/mess
is already here and this site, while free of its presence, is evidence of the
fact that it's here for good, and that there are no good solutions to combat
this.</p>
<p>Perhaps there doesn't need to be. Perhaps there should be. Perhaps this post,
like many others before it and many more afterwards, will be lost among a sea of
slop that surrounds and coils around us inextricably, a confused snake that
tangles the internet. It doesn't matter, but what I find concerning is the fact
even before AI, we never fully appreciated how much of the internet is
artificial and only now are we starting to grasp how bad this actually is.
Before AI, we were already grappling with fake news, fraudulent reviews,
websites being "optimised" to suit some unknown algorithm (see: SEO), websites
that reproduce content found on other websites for the sake of it. Something I
find even more worrying is the fact that AI is wanton to produce complete
nonsense which can (and will) lead to people being less informed and more
worried.</p>
<p>It's not all doom and gloom. One of the problems with my thought
experiment above is that it assumes that the customer will never decide to
actually start producing clothes themselves (either for personal use or to
sell), obviously not winning against a megacorporation that somehow produces
all the clothes in the world but at the very least maintaining the idea that
fashion is <em>not</em> entirely dead, that there still is sparks of hope. A similar
thing could and will probably happen here - people will start/continue to
produce their own content, not to combat AI but instead because we <em>can</em>.</p>
<p>I've seen some people tout the idea of "The Great Logging Off", where people
realise that most of the internet is just slop and decide generally to stop
using it. I don't think things will be as dramatic as that. I think instead
that people will start to realise and appreciate that the valuable content,
whether that be factual or opinionated, is hard: hard to create, hard to
maintain, hard to analyse. Part of that appreciation will be some level of risk
acceptance - we will continue to use AI, but significantly reduce our reliance
on it. Additionally, we will start to create our own small fragmented
communities, similar to the older days of the internet. We'll be okay. Fashion,
and the internet as a construct for humans to share ideas, will live on.</p>
